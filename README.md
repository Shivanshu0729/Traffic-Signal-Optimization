# Traffic-Signal-Optimization
Traffic Signal Optimization model is based on a hybrid system that combines a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Machine Learning (ML) using a Random Forest Regressor to optimize traffic signal timings at intersections. The system considers real-time traffic data like vehicle count, pedestrian presence, and emergency vehicles to dynamically adjust green, yellow, and red light durations. It improves traffic flow by predicting the best signal timings based on previous data and current conditions. Key features of your model include: dynamic signal optimization, pedestrian-friendly logic, emergency vehicle handling, real-time fitness evaluation, and learning from historical data to make smarter decisions over time.
